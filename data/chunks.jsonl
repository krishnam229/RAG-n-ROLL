These manufacturers have already optimized the parts they use to keep prices low and have little room to swap out existing parts for cheaper ones. Xiaomi and Honor have already started raising prices on their tablets, while Xiaomi has warned about price increases coming for its smartphones, too. Samsung and Apple, on the other hand, might have a bit more leeway, as they’re able to “secure memory supply 12-24 months in advance,” the IDC says.

There are no utility scale nuclear fusion power plants yet, despite the rush of initiatives to design one that might actually work. Success still depends on researchers solving significant scientific and engineering unknowns that they’ve been plugging away at for decades. How do we know TAE and Trump Media can actually make fusion power plants a reality? We don’t. As you can imagine, re-creating the dynamics of a star on Earth is very difficult. It takes an enormous amount of energy just to kick off a fusion reaction. A stumbling block scientists have faced for decades — and still face — is how to achieve a net energy gain from a fusion reaction. The first time anyone in the world was able to achieve that net energy gain, often referred to as “ignition,” was in 2022 at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s National Ignition Facility (NIF).

It’s a form of inertial confinement, triggering a fusion reaction by compressing and heating a fuel-filled target. Another competing fusion technology is called a tokamak, which uses magnetic fields to confine plasma and trigger the reaction. Re-creating the dynamics of a star on Earth is very difficult You can think of the reactor TAE is developing as a kind of a hybrid of both strategies, using what’s called field-reversed configuration (FRC).

Most experts The Verge has talked to over the years have been cautious to put a date on when a commercial fusion power plant could actually start powering homes and businesses. Not only does TAE still have to demonstrate that it can achieve a net energy gain — that gain has to be big enough to make economic sense. The Lawrence Livermore breakthrough, for example, achieved a net energy gain of 1.5 megajoule gain (the experiment yielded 3.15 megajoules of energy compared to the 2.05 megajoules the lasers used to trigger the fusion reaction). A laser fusion power plant would likely need to achieve a gain of 50 to 100. The lab has repeated its experiments to work to get higher gains — reaching a record gain of 4.13 MJ in April of this year. That’s all to say that there are still a lot of milestones for the industry to reach. The Trump administration released a roadmap in October for the advancement of fusion technologies, and the Department of Energy has set a goal of deploying commercial-scale fusion power to electricity grids by the mid-2030s. “We’re really at kind of that first-of-kind technology innovation, and it’s kind of hard to assign direct timelines"}

Commercial fusion reactors would also need robust supply chains for fuel and materials strong enough to withstand the extreme pressure and temperatures necessary for nuclear fusion. In short, designing a working reactor would be an enormous step forward — but then comes more difficult work to build the infrastructure and business around it. Then how big a deal is this merger? The biggest impact this merger is likely to have — if it ultimately goes through — is to infuse a lot more cash into TAE’s ambitions.
